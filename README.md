`frontier_exploration_ros2` is a powerful open-source frontier exploration package built for modern mobile robots. It is fast, reliable, and designed to make autonomous exploration feel practical, polished, and ready for real-world use.

Built and validated with ROS 2 Jazzy, it is still written with flexibility in mind. It fits naturally into Nav2-based projects, custom ROS 2 systems, and broader robotics workflows without making the exploration logic feel locked to a narrow setup.

More than a basic frontier package, it brings smarter exploration decisions and a stronger overall design. With map optimization before frontier detection, target ordering inspired by **Minimum Ratio Traveling Salesman Problem (MRTSP)**, and an efficient modern C++ implementation, it offers a more capable and more refined exploration experience.

This is not just a direct C++ port. It also improves long-running exploration with reusable caches, less repeated computation, and controlled memory use. Clear runtime controls for preemption, suppression, QoS, and completion handling make it easier to use in real projects.

In benchmarks against a Python-based frontier exploration package, our MRTSP mode delivered `72.2%` lower average CPU usage and `48.5%` lower average RAM usage. Our nearest mode reached `79.4%` lower average CPU usage and about `76.5%` lower average RAM usage.

## Overview

This package solves autonomous frontier exploration for occupancy-grid-based mobile robots. It detects frontiers on the boundary between known free space and unknown space, can optimize the decision map before WFD runs, selects an exploration target with either a nearest-frontier policy or an MRTSP-based global ordering policy, and continues until frontier exhaustion. In the default ROS 2 integration, those targets are dispatched through Nav2.

The implementation keeps the WFD-style frontier extraction backbone and extends it with decision-map optimization before frontier extraction, MRTSP-based ordering that uses **Minimum Ratio Traveling Salesman Problem (MRTSP) idea**, and runtime controls that are useful in production deployments:

- `nearest` and `mrtsp` frontier exploration strategies
- pre-WFD decision-map optimization with bilateral filtering and dilation
- global and local costmap filtering during frontier validation and goal selection
- startup-only map QoS autodetect for first-time integration
- frontier snapshot caching and deterministic frontier signatures
- post-goal settle logic to avoid immediate instability after a goal is reached
- explicit controls for visible-reveal-gain preemption and blocked-goal skipping
- optional frontier suppression and suppressed-frontier waiting behavior
- optional completion-event publishing for external orchestration
- optional return-to-start behavior after frontier exhaustion
- reusable C++ library export for custom integration paths

## Performance Comparison

The following table reports repository-specific runtime measurements gathered against a Python-based frontier exploration package under comparable workloads.

| Metric            | Python Package  | Our Package (Nearest) | Our Package (MRTSP - Optimized Map) |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| CPU usage range   | `%14.7 - %21.3` | `%3.5 - %4.3`         | `%3.7 - %8.0`                       |
| Average CPU usage | `%18.0`         | `%3.7`                | `%5.0`                              |
| Memory usage      | `%0.4`          | `%0.1`                | `%0.2`                              |
| Average RAM usage | `136 MB`        | `~32 MB`              | `~70 MB`                            |

Nearest mode uses `79.4%` less CPU and about `76.5%` less RAM than the Python package.
MRTSP mode uses `72.2%` less CPU and about `48.5%` less RAM than the Python package.
Idle and load stay close to each other. Reusable caches and avoiding repeated work keep usage stable, which makes the package suitable for high-efficiency systems such as Raspberry Pi.

## Research Basis

### Frontier Based Exploration for Autonomous Robot

The paper [Frontier Based Exploration for Autonomous Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03581) describes a WFD-style frontier detector built around a two-level breadth-first search. That paper provides the frontier-extraction backbone used here: expand through reachable map cells, detect frontier cells at the known/unknown boundary, and grow connected frontier clusters from those seeds.

### Enhancing autonomous exploration for robotics via real time map optimization and improved frontier costs

The paper [Enhancing autonomous exploration for robotics via real time map optimization and improved frontier costs](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-97231-9) adds two key ideas used in this package: map optimization before frontier extraction and a frontier cost model for exploration ordering. Together with WFD, these ideas shape the package: WFD handles frontier detection, while optimized maps and multi-factor costs improve target selection.

## Status

This package is written and tested for ROS 2 Jazzy. That target is explicit in the build, launch, and dependency surface, and future ports to other ROS 2 distributions can be considered on demand.

Even though the public deliverable is a ROS 2 package, the implementation is intentionally kept universal in structure. The exploration logic lives in a reusable C++ core, transport details stay at the node boundary, topic and QoS contracts are explicit, and completion handling remains external instead of being tied to a project-specific workflow.

In practice, that makes the package easier to reuse in Nav2 deployments, custom ROS 2 stacks, and later adaptations where the core exploration behavior needs to move into a different system layout.

## Verified Environment

The current implementation has been validated in a ROS 2 Jazzy exploration stack built around:

- Ubuntu 24.04
- ROS 2 Jazzy
- Gazebo Harmonic
- Nav2
- Slam Toolbox
- TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi

This is not the only supported integration path, but it is a verified environment in which the package has successfully completed frontier exploration with the expected map, costmap, TF, and navigation flow.

LiDAR quality is especially important for this package because frontier extraction, map optimization, blocked-goal checks, SLAM stability, and navigation progress all depend on the quality of the incoming scan data.

The verified TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi setup uses the ROBOTIS LDS-03 2D LiDAR. The LDS-03 provides 360-degree scanning and an official distance range of approximately `0.05 m` to `12.0 m`. In practice, exploration quality depends not only on the published sensor range, but also on mounting, scan cleanliness, environment reflectivity, filtering, and the usable range chosen by the navigation stack.

Exploration parameters can be strongly affected by LiDAR characteristics, so they should be tuned carefully for the actual sensor and environment.

The TurtleBot3 Waffle Pi is also a relatively small and slow robot, so parameter values may need to change on faster platforms.

### A Better Approach

In real autonomous exploration, not every tiny residual frontier is worth visiting. If very small and low-value regions are skipped, the robot can often achieve a major path reduction with only a minimal loss in total explored area.

This is especially effective in corridor-like maps, where narrow leftover fragments tend to add long detours and unnecessary turning for very little information gain.

## Design Goals

- Provide a C++ exploration package that is fast, predictable, and easy to integrate into real robotics systems, with a verified ROS 2 Jazzy path.
- Keep WFD-style frontier extraction while improving frontier quality and exploration ordering through pre-WFD map optimization and MRTSP-based selection.
- Support both local nearest selection and MRTSP-style global ordering from the same public interface.
- Expose a clean parameter surface for topics, frames, QoS, decision-map tuning, goal behavior, and completion hooks.
- Keep the default node integration practical for Nav2 while keeping the decision logic separated from project-specific backends.
- Make namespace-aware deployment and multi-robot integration practical.
- Keep the package public and universal. The package should be usable without assuming a specific robot, simulator, map saver, or private stack.

<p align="right"><a href="#frontier_exploration_ros2">back to top</a></p>

## Architecture

The package includes four main pieces:

- `frontier_explorer`: public executable that subscribes to map and costmap topics, queries TF, and talks to Nav2 `NavigateToPose`.
- `frontier_exploration_ros2::frontier_exploration_ros2_core`: reusable C++ core library that contains frontier search, decision-map construction, strategy-dependent frontier selection, goal-state handling, settle logic, active-goal preemption, blocked-goal handling, and suppression orchestration.
- `control_exploration`: optional typed ROS service used to start, stop, schedule, and optionally shut down the explorer process.
- `frontier_exploration_ctl`: packaged CLI helper for sending exploration control requests from the terminal.
- `launch/frontier_explorer.launch.py`: package-owned example launch file.
- `config/params.yaml`: packaged baseline parameter file.

At runtime, the node expects:

- an occupancy map topic
- a global costmap topic
- a local costmap topic
- a TF transform from `global_frame` to `robot_base_frame`
- a Nav2 `navigate_to_pose` action server, or another action server reachable under the configured action name

The decision path is structured in stages:

- map ingestion and occupancy-grid wrapping
- optional decision-map optimization with bilateral filtering and dilation
- WFD-style frontier extraction on the active decision map
- strategy branch:
  - `nearest`: materialize reachable goal points around frontier clusters and select by frontier policy
  - `mrtsp`: keep frontier cluster geometry, build an MRTSP-style cost matrix, and dispatch the first frontier from the ordered sequence
- action dispatch, map/costmap monitoring, and runtime policy handling

The package can also publish a completion event through `std_msgs/msg/Empty`. This is intentionally optional and transport-light. The explorer only reports completion. Any map export, mission chaining, docking, or higher-level orchestration should be implemented outside the package.

The node also supports a cold-idle runtime mode. When the explorer is idle, it keeps the control service, action client, TF, and publishers available, but does not keep map or costmap subscriptions alive. This allows the package to remain available for orchestration while avoiding unnecessary map and costmap processing before exploration is started. In the packaged configuration, this mode is available when you explicitly set `autostart:=false` or stop the explorer at runtime. Cold-idle mode always keeps the control service enabled, even if `control_service_enabled=false` is requested.

Two optional debug publishers are also available:

- `selected_frontier_topic` publishes the selected target pose
- `optimized_map_topic` publishes the optimized occupancy grid used for decision making

These debug outputs are published only when debug logging is enabled for the node.

When suppression is enabled, the core can temporarily exclude repeatedly failing frontier areas and optionally wait under a temporary return-to-start goal while all currently detected frontiers remain suppressed. That temporary return path is separate from normal exploration completion.

## Algorithm and Mathematics

### Frontier Definition

The package follows the classical frontier idea: a frontier is an unknown cell that borders free space.

The eligibility test implemented in the search layer can be summarized as:

```text
frontier(p) is true if:
  map(p) = unknown
  and there exists q in N(p) such that map(q) = free
  and there does not exist q in N(p) blocked by the active costmap policy
```

`N(p)` is the local neighborhood around cell `p`. The implementation uses an 8-connected neighborhood plus the center cell for local scans.

### WFD-Style Two-Level Search

The core search keeps the WFD idea from [Frontier Based Exploration for Autonomous Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.03581). The code uses two BFS layers:

1. A map-space BFS expands through reachable map cells.
2. When a frontier cell is found, a frontier BFS grows that connected frontier cluster.

The search flow is:

```text
1. Project the robot pose into map coordinates.
2. If the robot starts in unknown or occupied space, recover the nearest free seed.
3. Expand a BFS over reachable map cells.
4. When a frontier cell is detected, grow the full connected frontier cluster.
5. Reject tiny clusters.
6. Build one frontier candidate from that cluster.
7. Repeat until the reachable map area is exhausted.
```

This preserves the core WFD idea while adapting it to a ROS 2 exploration stack that also reasons over global and local costmaps.

### Frontier Candidate Geometry

Each frontier cluster is converted into a `FrontierCandidate` with:

- a centroid used for ranking and equivalence checks
- a center point used as the MRTSP dispatch baseline
- a start world point used by the MRTSP path-cost calculation
- an optional reachable goal point used by nearest-style navigation dispatch
- a cluster size used as the information-gain proxy

The centroid is computed directly from frontier cells:

```text
c_x = (1 / N) * sum(x_i)
c_y = (1 / N) * sum(y_i)
```

In `nearest` mode, the node searches free and unblocked neighbors around frontier cells and selects a reachable navigation point close to the centroid:

```text
choose g that minimizes ||g - c||^2
subject to:
  g is free
  g is not blocked in the global costmap
  g is not blocked in the local costmap
  and optionally ||g - r||^2 >= d_min^2
```

Where:

- `c` is the frontier centroid
- `g` is the candidate goal point
- `r` is the robot position
- `d_min` is the active minimum-distance gate

If no goal candidate satisfies the distance constraint, the implementation falls back to the best unconstrained reachable point.

### Decision-Map Optimization

The decision-map stage is inspired by the 2025 paper and implemented directly in this package. The purpose is to reduce invalid frontiers caused by sparse sensing while preserving occupied structure.

The occupancy grid is first mapped into a paper-style image:

- occupied = `0`
- unknown = `205`
- free = `255`

Let `I(p)` be the paper-image value at cell `p`. The bilateral filter uses a spatial-domain Gaussian and a range-domain Gaussian:

```text
G_s(p, q) = exp(-||p - q||^2 / (2 * sigma_s^2))
G_r(p, q) = exp(-(I(p) - I(q))^2 / (2 * sigma_r^2))
```

The normalization term and filtered value are:

```text
W(p) = sum_{q in S} G_s(p, q) * G_r(p, q)
I_bar(p) = (1 / W(p)) * sum_{q in S} G_s(p, q) * G_r(p, q) * I(q)
```

Where `S` is the local filter support around `p`.

After filtering, the package thresholds the image back into a frontier-decision image:

- cells above the free/unknown midpoint become free
- cells below that threshold become unknown
- occupied cells from the raw image remain occupied

Finally, the package applies circular free-space dilation with radius `dilation_kernel_radius_cells` over the thresholded result. This expands filtered free support while keeping occupied cells fixed.

In practice, this stage:

- reduces invalid frontiers caused by sparse sensing
- preserves occupied cells
- keeps narrow traversable passages when the optimization parameters are tuned conservatively

### Frontier Cost Model

In `mrtsp` mode, the package uses frontier size as the information-gain proxy:

```text
P(V_i, V_j) = size(V_j)
```

The path-cost term follows the candidate geometry used in the implementation:

```text
d(V_i, V_j) = max(d_m + d_u, d_n + d_v) - r_s
```

Where:

- `d_m` is the distance from the source frontier center point to the target frontier center point
- `d_n` is the distance from the source frontier center point to the target frontier centroid
- `d_u` is the distance from the target frontier center point to the target start world point
- `d_v` is the distance from the target frontier centroid to the target start world point
- `r_s` is `sensor_effective_range_m`

The implementation uses frontier cluster size as the gain term. The path-cost term can become negative when a candidate frontier is effectively already within sensing range. That behavior is intentional because it biases ordering toward frontiers that can expose area efficiently with less added travel.

### MRTSP Ordering

Once frontier path cost and information gain are available, the package builds a directed MRTSP-style cost matrix over the robot start node and all frontier candidates.

For frontier-to-frontier transitions, the heuristic is:

```text
M(i, j) = (weight_distance_wd * d(V_i, V_j)) / (weight_gain_ws * P(V_i, V_j))
```

For start-to-frontier transitions, the package adds a lower-bound start term derived from robot translation and heading limits:

```text
M(0, j) =
  (weight_distance_wd * d(V_0, V_j)) / (weight_gain_ws * P(V_0, V_j))
  + t_lb(j)
```

With:

```text
t_lb(j) = min(
  L(robot, V_j) / max_linear_speed_vmax,
  |delta_yaw(robot, V_j)| / max_angular_speed_wmax
)
```

This package uses a greedy traversal over that MRTSP-style matrix. It is therefore a practical ROS 2 implementation of the paper's decision model, not an exhaustive MRTSP solver.

Three implementation details matter in practice:

- in `mrtsp` mode, frontier dispatch uses `center_point` when no reachable navigation `goal_point` is materialized
- `mrtsp` mode forces decision-map optimization on even if `frontier_map_optimization_enabled=false`
- `nearest` mode still materializes reachable goal points and can use local costmap-aware frontier eligibility during candidate construction

### Nearest Strategy Selection

After frontier extraction, the node selects a target according to the current nearest-frontier policy:

- preferred frontier: closest frontier that still satisfies `frontier_selection_min_distance`
- escape frontier: farthest candidate when no preferred frontier is available and escape mode is still active
- close-range fallback: farthest remaining candidate when the preferred path is unavailable

The escape path is deliberate. It helps the robot move away from a locally congested or trivial region until the first successful frontier goal is completed. When a second frontier is available, the dispatched goal orientation is also biased toward that next frontier to reduce unnecessary reorientation after arrival.

### Costmap Blocking Policy

The package uses both global and local costmaps during search and during active-goal monitoring.

The blocking rule is intentionally strict:

```text
blocked(world_point) is true if any active costmap reports cost > OCC_THRESHOLD
```

This affects two stages:

- frontier eligibility: unknown cells next to blocked neighbors are not treated as valid frontiers
- goal-point materialization: free neighbors that are blocked in either costmap are rejected

This is one of the key extensions beyond a plain frontier-only implementation. It improves robustness in cluttered environments and reduces the number of goals that are technically frontier-adjacent but not operationally navigable.

### Deterministic Frontier Signatures

The implementation quantizes frontier reference points and goal points into a stable signature:

```text
q = max(frontier_visit_tolerance, 0.1)
signature(F) = sort(round(ref_x / q), round(ref_y / q), round(goal_x / q), round(goal_y / q))
```

This signature is used for:

- snapshot cache validation
- stable publish suppression for RViz markers
- post-goal settle checks
- MRTSP order-cache validation

It reduces noise from small floating-point jitter and helps keep runtime behavior deterministic.

### Post-Goal Settle Logic

After a frontier goal succeeds, the node does not immediately send the next goal when `post_goal_settle_enabled=true`. Instead it waits until the map has settled.

The readiness rule is:

```text
ready if:
  map_updated
  and elapsed >= post_goal_min_settle
  and map_updates_seen >= post_goal_required_map_updates
  and stable_update_count >= post_goal_stable_updates
```

This is a practical improvement over simpler exploration loops that can re-goal too quickly while SLAM or costmaps are still converging.

### Preemption and Blocked-Goal Design

Two parameters are deliberately exposed as policy controls:

- `goal_preemption_enabled`
- `goal_skip_on_blocked_goal`

They are design choices, not incidental flags.

`goal_preemption_enabled` allows the active frontier goal to be reconsidered when target-pose visible reveal gain is exhausted.

`goal_skip_on_blocked_goal` allows the active frontier goal to be skipped when the target becomes blocked in the local or global costmap. If another frontier is available, the explorer moves on to it. If not, the blocked goal can be canceled explicitly.

Visible-reveal-gain preemption evaluates the target pose with an occlusion-aware visible reveal estimate. As long as that estimate says the active goal still offers useful reveal on arrival, the current goal is kept. When that gain no longer justifies staying on the active target, the explorer can switch using the refreshed frontier set.

The current implementation also applies:

- a minimum time gap between visible-reveal-gain preemption attempts
- an optional completion distance that can treat a near-arrived frontier as finished before replacement is evaluated further
- a stability requirement so replacement candidates must be observed repeatedly before a switch is made

Together, these controls help the explorer stay responsive without turning preemption into unstable goal switching.

`goal_preemption_complete_if_within_m` is especially useful when visible-reveal-gain preemption would otherwise be too aggressive near arrival, because it lets the system accept "close enough" as effectively complete and move on cleanly. It should still be used carefully on robots that prioritize conservative obstacle avoidance: if this threshold is set too large, the robot can mark a frontier complete before the intended sensing pose is meaningfully reached, which can in turn produce wrong exploration transitions.

### Frontier Suppression and Failure Memory

Suppression is an optional policy layer that temporarily removes repeatedly failing frontier goal areas from consideration without marking exploration as complete.

The implementation is reason-agnostic at the policy level. It does not try to infer whether a failure came from Nav2, another action backend, a planner limitation, or a temporary bring-up condition. Instead it tracks repeated failed attempts at the frontier goal point and promotes those failures into temporary square suppression regions.

The attempt key is quantized with the same tolerance family used elsewhere in the core:

```text
q = max(frontier_visit_tolerance, 0.1)
attempt_key(g) = (round(g_x / q), round(g_y / q))
```

Where `g` is the actual navigation goal point, not the frontier centroid.

After a configurable number of failed attempts, the implementation creates a square suppression region:

```text
center = g
side_length = frontier_suppression_base_size_m
```

If another matured failed goal lands in the outer expansion band of an existing region, the region grows instead of creating a second nearby fragment:

```text
inner square  = C x C
outer square  = (C + B) x (C + B)
if g is in outer - inner:
  new_center = midpoint(old_center, g)
  new_side_length = 2 * C
```

Where:

- `C` is the current region side length
- `B` is `frontier_suppression_expansion_size_m`

Membership is evaluated with the selected goal point. The suppression policy does not use the centroid for region filtering.

The suppression state is also bounded by design:

- failed attempt records are stored in a capped hash map
- suppression regions are stored in a capped vector
- both use TTL-based cleanup
- both use oldest-entry eviction if the configured hard cap is reached

That keeps the feature operationally safe for long-running deployments.

### No-Progress Detection

Suppression also includes a no-progress watchdog for accepted frontier goals.

The watchdog reads `distance_remaining` from the action feedback stream and tracks the best observed value. A goal is considered to have made meaningful progress only when the best distance improves by at least `frontier_suppression_progress_epsilon_m` since the last meaningful progress point.

The rule can be summarized as:

```text
meaningful_progress if:
  distance_at_last_progress - best_distance_remaining >= progress_epsilon
```

The timeout rule is:

```text
no_progress if:
  now - last_meaningful_progress_time >= no_progress_timeout
```

There is no separate time window attached to `frontier_suppression_progress_epsilon_m`. The expected interpretation is:

- achieve at least that much meaningful improvement
- before `frontier_suppression_no_progress_timeout_s` expires

If that does not happen, the active frontier goal is canceled and counted as a failed attempt.

### Startup Grace Period

Suppression is intentionally delayed during startup when `frontier_suppression_startup_grace_period_s` is greater than zero.

During that grace period, suppression filtering, failed-attempt recording, and no-progress cancelation stay disabled. This helps avoid poisoning suppression memory while Nav2, TF, or costmaps are still stabilizing.

### Suppressed-Frontier Waiting Policy

`All currently detected frontiers are temporarily suppressed` is not the same condition as `No more frontiers found`.

The first means frontier candidates still exist but are currently excluded by suppression. The second means frontier search found no candidates at all.

When all current candidates are suppressed, `all_frontiers_suppressed_behavior` controls the response:

- `stay`: wait in place for map or costmap changes
- `return_to_start`: temporarily navigate back to the recorded start pose

This temporary return behavior is separate from `return_to_start_on_complete`. It does not mark exploration complete, and it is canceled automatically if usable frontier candidates appear again.

## Quick Start

> [!WARNING]
> WFD-based frontier extraction tends to select points close to obstacles. The packaged config enables `goal_preemption_enabled` by default, and it is still strongly recommended to also enable `goal_skip_on_blocked_goal` in your runtime configuration.

The packaged parameter file defaults to `strategy: nearest`. To switch to MRTSP ordering, set `strategy: mrtsp` in your parameter file.

Launch with the packaged parameter file:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py
```

The packaged launch file uses the packaged `config/params.yaml` defaults, and that baseline starts exploration immediately with `autostart:=true`.

Override the parameter file:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/params.yaml
```

Run under a namespace:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  namespace:=robot1
```

Enable simulation time:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

Override startup map durability:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  map_qos_durability:=volatile
```

Enable startup-only map QoS autodetect:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  map_qos_autodetect_on_startup:=true \
  map_qos_autodetect_timeout_s:=2.0
```

Keep the node in cold idle at launch time:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  autostart:=false
```

Disable the runtime control service while keeping automatic startup:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  autostart:=true \
  control_service_enabled:=false
```

### Runtime Control

When `control_service_enabled=true`, the node exposes a `control_exploration` service using `frontier_exploration_ros2/srv/ControlExploration`. This service provides an explicit runtime control surface for exploration lifecycle management. It is available even when exploration starts automatically, and is mainly useful for stop, delayed start/stop, cold-idle orchestration, and optional self-shutdown flows. If `autostart=false`, the node keeps this service enabled regardless of the configured `control_service_enabled` value so the cold-idle session can still be started.

The packaged CLI helper provides a convenient terminal interface for that service:

```bash
frontier_exploration_ctl start
frontier_exploration_ctl start -t 10
frontier_exploration_ctl stop
frontier_exploration_ctl stop -t 10
frontier_exploration_ctl stop -q
frontier_exploration_ctl stop -t 10 -q
```

Command semantics:

- `start` enables exploration. If the node is in cold idle, it recreates the required subscriptions and timers, resets session-local exploration state, and begins exploration after fresh input data arrive.
- `stop` disables exploration, prevents further goal dispatch, and returns the node to cold idle so that map and costmap traffic are no longer processed.
- `-t <seconds>` schedules the request after the given delay instead of applying it immediately.
- `stop -q` performs a normal stop sequence and then shuts down the explorer node process.

If the control service is disabled while `autostart=true`, the CLI helper and RViz control panel cannot send runtime commands to that explorer instance.

When the package is started with its own example launch file, `stop -q` also causes that launch session to exit after the explorer process stops. It does not attempt to terminate unrelated nodes, external launch parents, or arbitrary terminal sessions. Higher-level process orchestration remains outside the scope of this package.

## Rviz Plugin

`frontier_exploration_ros2` also provides an optional RViz plugin for start and stop exploration control directly from RViz.

## Integration Guide

### Required Interfaces

The node expects the following interfaces to exist in the running system:

| Interface             | Default                  | Purpose                                                               |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Occupancy grid topic  | `map`                    | Frontier extraction and decision-map input                            |
| Global costmap topic  | `global_costmap/costmap` | Reachability and blocked-goal filtering                               |
| Local costmap topic   | `local_costmap/costmap`  | Near-field blocked-goal filtering                                     |
| Nav2 action           | `navigate_to_pose`       | Goal execution                                                        |
| TF transform          | `map -> base_footprint`  | Robot pose lookup                                                     |
| Frontier marker topic | `explore/frontiers`      | Visualization                                                         |
| Control service       | `control_exploration`    | Optional runtime start, stop, schedule, and quit control when enabled |

### Topic and Frame Mapping

For most integrations, only these fields need to be remapped:

- `map_topic`
- `costmap_topic`
- `local_costmap_topic`
- `navigate_to_pose_action_name`
- `global_frame`
- `robot_base_frame`
- `frontier_marker_topic`
- `selected_frontier_topic`
- `optimized_map_topic`

All defaults are relative topic names inside the package-owned baseline config. That keeps the package namespace-friendly in multi-robot deployments. If your system uses absolute topic names, provide them explicitly in your parameter file.

### Nav2 Integration

The public node is designed around `nav2_msgs/action/NavigateToPose`.

The explorer:

- waits for the action server with a bounded timeout
- dispatches one frontier goal at a time
- receives feedback and result callbacks
- can request cancelation during preemption flows

If your stack wraps Nav2 behind a namespace or a remapped action name, update `navigate_to_pose_action_name` accordingly.

If suppression is enabled, repeated rejected goals, aborted goals, or no-progress timeout cancelations can temporarily remove a frontier area from selection.

### Multi-Robot and Namespace Use

The launch file accepts a `namespace` argument and all packaged topic defaults are relative. That makes the package suitable for:

- one explorer per robot namespace
- one Nav2 stack per robot namespace
- one map and costmap graph per robot namespace

Example:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  namespace:=robot1 \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/robot1_frontier.yaml
```

### Completion Event Consumption

When `completion_event_enabled` is `true`, the explorer publishes one `std_msgs/msg/Empty` message when frontier exhaustion is observed.

Completion event QoS:

- durability: `transient_local`
- reliability: `reliable`
- depth: `1`

Design intent:

- the explorer reports completion
- external systems decide what to do next
- late-joining subscribers can still see the latest completion event while the explorer node remains alive

Typical consumers include:

- map export services
- docking or return-home supervisors
- mission sequencers
- test automation scripts

Suppressed return-to-start is different. If `all_frontiers_suppressed_behavior=return_to_start`, the robot may temporarily go back to the start pose while waiting for new frontier opportunities, but that does not publish a completion event and does not mean exploration has finished.

### Reusing the C++ Core Library

The package exports a reusable C++ target:

```cmake
find_package(frontier_exploration_ros2 REQUIRED)

add_executable(my_explorer src/my_explorer.cpp)
target_link_libraries(my_explorer
  frontier_exploration_ros2::frontier_exploration_ros2_core
)
```

The core separates the exploration logic from the public node for custom ROS 2 integrations.

### Suppression Behavior in Practice

Suppression is most useful in systems where the same frontier can fail repeatedly for operational reasons that are not visible in the occupancy map alone. Common examples include:

- a navigation stack that comes up later than the explorer
- a planner that keeps rejecting a narrow or unstable goal area
- a controller that stalls near clutter without making meaningful progress
- a temporary map or costmap inconsistency during bring-up

In those cases, suppression adds three controls:

- startup grace delays suppression until the initial system bring-up window has passed
- failure memory temporarily removes repeatedly failing goal areas from reselection
- optional temporary return-to-start behavior avoids treating the situation as exploration complete

If the frontier set changes and a usable candidate appears again, the temporary return-to-start goal is canceled and frontier exploration resumes automatically.

## QoS Configuration

### Supported User-Facing Tokens

Accepted durability values:

- `transient_local`
- `volatile`
- `system_default`

Accepted reliability values:

- `reliable`
- `best_effort`
- `system_default`

### Default QoS Profiles

| Channel          | Default durability | Default reliability           | Default depth                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Map              | `transient_local`  | `reliable`                    | `1`                           |
| Global costmap   | `volatile`         | `reliable`                    | `10`                          |
| Local costmap    | `volatile`         | `inherit` from global costmap | `inherit` from global costmap |
| Completion event | `transient_local`  | `reliable`                    | `1`                           |

The local costmap subscriber always uses volatile durability. Reliability and depth can either inherit the global costmap settings or be overridden explicitly.

### Startup-Only Map Durability Autodetect

If the correct map durability is not known during first integration, the package can probe it at startup.

Behavior:

1. Start with the configured map durability.
2. Wait for `map_qos_autodetect_timeout_s`.
3. If no map is received and the configured durability is `transient_local` or `volatile`, switch once to the opposite durability.
4. If a map arrives, lock that choice and stop autodetect.
5. If neither attempt succeeds, stop autodetect and report failure.

This process is strictly startup-only. It does not keep switching at runtime.

### Autodetect Log Meanings

The node emits machine-parsable logs with a fixed prefix:

```text
[qos-autodetect] START selected=<durability> timeout=<seconds>
[qos-autodetect] SWITCH selected=<durability> elapsed=<seconds>
[qos-autodetect] COMPLETE result=<initial|fallback|failed> selected=<durability> elapsed=<seconds>
```

Interpretation:

- `result=initial`: the first configured durability worked
- `result=fallback`: the fallback durability worked
- `result=failed`: neither attempt received a map within the startup window

Recommended integration sequence:

1. Enable autodetect once during bring-up.
2. Read the `COMPLETE` log.
3. Copy the working durability into your permanent parameter file.
4. Disable autodetect for regular deployments.

Suppression does not define its own QoS policy, but it is still relevant during first integration. If map QoS is wrong or the navigation stack comes up late, the explorer can observe unstable early behavior. The recommended pattern is:

1. fix map QoS first
2. use startup grace while validating navigation bring-up timing
3. then tune suppression thresholds only after the transport layer is stable

Notes:

- `params_file` controls the full YAML source for the node.
- the launch file only overrides `autostart`, `control_service_enabled`, the QoS-related parameters listed above, and `use_sim_time`
- all other node behavior is defined by the selected parameter file
- strategy selection, decision-map tuning, suppression behavior, startup grace, and suppressed-frontier waiting policy are configured in YAML, not through dedicated launch arguments

<p align="right"><a href="#frontier_exploration_ros2">back to top</a></p>

## Parameter Reference

Parameters are declared in `frontier_explorer_node.cpp`.

The packaged launch path uses `config/params.yaml` as its baseline parameter file, so launched behavior may differ from the declared defaults where that YAML intentionally overrides them. Notable examples are `occ_threshold` and `goal_preemption_enabled`: the node declares `50` and `false`, while the packaged YAML sets `60` and `true`.

### Example Launch

Assuming TurtleBot3, SLAM, and Nav2 are already running:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/tb3_waffle_pi_frontier.yaml \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

For a namespaced robot:

```bash
ros2 launch frontier_exploration_ros2 frontier_explorer.launch.py \
  namespace:=tb3 \
  params_file:=/absolute/path/to/tb3_waffle_pi_frontier.yaml \
  use_sim_time:=true
```

### What To Verify During Bring-Up

- `/map` is available and uses the expected QoS profile
- `/global_costmap/costmap` is available
- `/local_costmap/costmap` is available
- `map -> base_footprint` exists in TF
- `navigate_to_pose` is reachable
- the LiDAR scan quality is stable enough for SLAM, decision-map optimization, and costmap updates
- the robot can receive and complete Nav2 goals before exploration is started
- if you use debug inspection, the selected frontier and optimized map topics are visible while debug logging is enabled
- the completion event topic is subscribed by an external consumer if post-processing is needed

## Testing

Run package tests with:

```bash
cd <your_workspace>
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon test --packages-select frontier_exploration_ros2
colcon test-result --verbose
```

Current test coverage includes:

- frontier extraction behavior
- snapshot cache behavior
- deterministic frontier results
- marker publish deduplication
- preemption and cancelation flow
- runtime control service behavior
- cold-idle subscription gating
- CLI parsing for delayed start, stop, and stop quit
- frontier suppression, no-progress timeout, startup grace, and temporary return-to-start behavior
- QoS parsing and startup autodetect behavior
- decision-map optimization math
- occupied-cell preservation under map optimization
- doorway preservation under map optimization
- incremental dirty-region recomputation for the decision map
- MRTSP ordering determinism
- MRTSP candidate distance filtering
- dispatch-point behavior in nearest vs MRTSP mode

## Contributing

This package is currently maintained by a single developer. Contributions are welcome and useful, especially in areas that improve portability, performance, test coverage, documentation quality, and integration breadth.

### What Helps Most

- bug reports with reproducible logs and parameter files
- integration reports from different robots, maps, and Nav2 setups
- performance measurements with clear test conditions
- tests for edge cases in frontier extraction, decision-map behavior, QoS handling, and preemption flow
- documentation improvements that make the package easier to adopt

### Before Opening an Issue

Please include:

- ROS 2 distribution
- operating system version
- robot model or simulation stack
- LiDAR model
- scan topic name
- LiDAR configured min/max range
- approximate practical usable range in your environment if it differs from the configured range
- scan rate or angular resolution if you changed the default sensor setup
- any scan filtering, cropping, downsampling, or obstacle-layer preprocessing applied before navigation
- relevant topic names
- TF frame names
- QoS settings if they differ from defaults
- the parameter file you used
- logs that show the problem

If the issue is QoS-related, include the output of:

```bash
ros2 topic info -v /map
ros2 topic info -v /global_costmap/costmap
ros2 topic info -v /local_costmap/costmap
```

### Before Opening a Pull Request

Please make sure the change:

- is focused and reviewable
- keeps the package universal and free of project-specific assumptions
- includes tests when behavior changes
- updates the README when the public integration surface changes
- keeps parameter names and examples aligned with the code

### Suggested Contribution Workflow

```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-change
source /opt/ros/jazzy/setup.bash
colcon build --packages-select frontier_exploration_ros2
colcon test --packages-select frontier_exploration_ros2
```

Then open a pull request with:

- a short problem statement
- the technical approach
- any parameter or QoS changes
- test evidence
- migration notes if existing users must update configs

### Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] code builds on ROS 2 Jazzy
- [ ] tests pass
